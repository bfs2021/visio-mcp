# Visio and Word acceptance checklist (I41)

How to run: `dotnet test tests/Diagram.Windows.Tests --filter OfficeAcceptance`. The test drives the installed Visio and Word through their own automation interfaces (not library reopening), starts the real application and a real MCP client, and writes `docs/acceptance/evidence/WA-xx/result.json` plus screenshots and files. A machine without Visio or Word records `NOT RUN` and passes nothing. Results by date: `WA-results-<date>.md`.

The scenario is spec section 23, steps 10 to 14, on a drawing made through MCP: four labelled blocks with three glued connectors, an annotation, a grouped pair, a picture, and two layers with one block in both.

| ID | Scenario | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| WA-01 | Record Windows, Visio, .NET versions | versions written to `result.json` |
| WA-02 | `export_document` writes a .vsdx; Visio opens it | no repair prompt; every canvas object has a Visio shape carrying its full UUID in `User.AgentId`; screenshot |
| WA-03 | Edit text, fill and position of exported shapes in Visio | edits accepted through Visio's own object model |
| WA-04 | Move a connected shape in Visio | connector keeps both connections and its end follows the shape; screenshot |
| WA-05 | Picture: independent object, bytes hash kept; picture replaced outside the app with stale User cells | Visio shows a picture shape with the host's SHA-256; reopening a swapped package reports `picture_replaced` and does not apply the old provenance |
| WA-06 | Visio saves; the application opens the saved file | every pre-export UUID resolves via `get_objects`; text, fill, move and glue edits made in Visio are kept; identity report recorded |
| WA-07 | Duplicate a shape in Visio (copies the UUID) | the importer gives every object a unique id; the original keeps its id |
| WA-08 | Resize a group in Visio | members scale in Visio and in the application after reopening |
| WA-09 | One shape in two layers; hide a layer | membership kept through a Visio save; policy: a shape may belong to several layers |
| WA-10 | Word: embed, activate, edit, save, reopen, reactivate | OLE object is `Visio.Drawing.15`; activation exposes the drawing; an edit made while embedded persists after Word saves and reopens |
| WA-11 | Unsupported or lossy content stays visible | a stencil-master shape drawn in Visio opens as an ordinary shape and the report names it (`master_inlined`); lossy export refusal is covered by the `compatibility_loss` tests |
| WA-12 | Native segment of the demonstration, steps 10 to 14 | rows for steps 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 each PASS |

Not part of this suite: spec steps 1 to 9 (done in I12 to I31; the logo swap is I50), and checks that need a person at the screen (the results file says what was not observed by a person).
