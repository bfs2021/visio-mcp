# visio-mcp

A Windows desktop diagram editor that a person and an LLM can edit together, with
native Microsoft Visio (`.vsdx`) files that stay editable in Visio rather than being
flattened into a picture.

- **Human editing:** shapes, glued connectors, text, images, layers, align and format,
  on a page-oriented canvas.
- **Agent editing:** an MCP server exposes typed, atomic, revision-checked operations on
  objects with persistent IDs, so an agent can change one object without regenerating
  the drawing. It can also render pages and regions to check its own layout.
- **Visio interoperability:** export and re-import of `.vsdx`, keeping agent IDs in
  Visio user cells across a round trip.

Planned stack: React + TypeScript + maxGraph, a .NET 10 WPF/WebView2 host, OfficeIMO.Visio
and the official C# MCP SDK.

## Status

Early stage. The design and implementation plan are done. Package **I00** (pinned probe
dependencies and a minimal request-envelope schema) is complete. Next are the M0 feasibility
probes, which must prove that editable `.vsdx` files with glued connectors work in real
Visio and Word before any production code is written.
See [IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md).

## Running the contract tests

Requires Node.js 24.

```sh
cd spikes/contract-tests
npm ci
npm test
```

## MCP operation discovery

Before constructing an `apply_operations` batch, call `get_operation_schema` with
no arguments to list the supported operation names. Call it again with, for example,
`{"operation":"resize"}` to get a self-contained JSON Schema, an example operation,
coordinate units, batch limits and targeting guidance. Discovery works even when the
desktop editor is closed. Schemas are embedded from `contracts/` at build time.

Read `get_document_summary` before editing to obtain the document/session identity,
current revision and object UUIDs. Example UUIDs and asset references are placeholders;
replace them with actual identities and approved assets. Use `resize` for bounds,
`move` for position and `set` for text/style patches. Prefer UUID targets on multipage
documents. See `contracts/fixtures/operation-examples.json` for the validated examples.

For existing labels, call `get_text_layout` with `documentId`, `sessionId` and `ids`.
It returns measurements and suggested operations without changing the document.
Choose `strategy: "grow_box"` to preserve font size or `"shrink_font"` to preserve
the box (`minFontSizePt` defaults to 8). Apply the returned `operations` through
`apply_operations` using the returned `revision` as `baseRevision` and a new
transaction UUID. A conflicting edit requires measuring again.

`target: "visio"` adds conservative font/symbol allowances and reports export risks.
These are estimates, not native Visio measurements: render and inspect the export
before relying on its appearance. Requests support at most 50 text objects or
text-bearing shapes and 131,072 characters; groups, connectors and pictures are not
supported by this first text-fitting tool.

## Reference and canvas comparison

Add a reference screenshot with **Pictures → Add to library…**, then call
`list_assets` to obtain its ID, scope and SHA-256 version. The MCP never reads an
agent-supplied file path. These tools support approved PNG, JPEG and BMP references.

- `render_reference_region`: pass document/session identity, `referenceAssetId`,
  `referenceSha256`, `referenceScope` (library or document), and
  `cropPx: {x,y,width,height}` in **integer original-image pixels**. `scale` defaults
  to 8 (range 1–16). The tool returns an enlarged PNG with nearest-pixel sampling.
- `compare_reference`: pass the same source crop plus `pageId` and exactly one of
  canvas `bounds: {x,y,width,height}` in **document points**, or `elementIds`.
  `mode` is `side_by_side` (default) or `overlay`; `panelSizePx` defaults to 512.
  Canvas `paddingPt` defaults to 6 to protect edge strokes. Alias/name lookup is scoped to the page.

Both tools are read-only. Results include the source hash, document revision,
original dimensions, crop and output rectangles, and coordinate mappings. Each
comparison crop is fitted and centred without stretching; different aspect ratios
are reported. The overlay draws the reference first, then the canvas at 50% opacity.
Use side-by-side views for dark-source/light-canvas comparisons. There is no
automatic accuracy score, alignment or reconstruction of missing source detail.
See [R06/R07](docs/m5/R06-R07-reference-comparison.md) for examples and limits.
